        I graduated from <strong>Lehigh University</strong> in 2018 with a
        bachelors in bioengineering. After working for a little over a year at a
        pharmaceutical start up, I began to realize that this career path wasn't
        providing me the day to day excitement and challenges that I wanted.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right when I felt stuck within my career path, I came across coding. I
        was instantly hooked. I hadn't been so engaged and challenged by
        something in a while, and I was having fun while doing it. With coding,
        I could mix my passion for design and problem solving all in one.
        <br />
        <br />
        The posibilities are endless, and I know that this is something that I
        can see myself doing for the rest of my life. Check out some cool
        projects I've made below!
